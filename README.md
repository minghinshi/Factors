# Factors
 A game about factoring numbers. The original game is [Wallprime](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baton.wallprime).

# Rough plans
- Move the game to Godot
- Allow pausing and exiting the game
- Remove questions that are already prime numbers (no free points!)
- Add support for using the keyboard to play
- Show upcoming numbers (like the "next" queue in Tetris)
- Hard mode where you must factor a number in one go
