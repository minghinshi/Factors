# Factors
 A game about factoring numbers.

# Rough plans
- Move the game to Godot
- Allow pausing and exiting the game
- Remove questions that are already prime numbers (no free points!)
- Add support for using the keyboard to input prime numbers
- Show upcoming numbers (like the "next" queue in Tetris)
